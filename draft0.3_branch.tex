\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background}
Natural disasters often bring huge casualties and economic losses on human society. In 2017, the worst hurricane in nearly a century landed in Puerto Rico, and left almost the entire island without power, and many without running water or cell phone service. Many highways and roads were blocked because of widespread flooding, which brought great difficulties to rescue route planning. Demand for medical supplies was also soaring for some time. \\

\noindent HELP, Inc., one of non-governmental organizations, is planning to design a transportable disaster response system called DroneGo to conduct medical supply delivery and video reconnaissance.

\subsection{Restatement of Problem}

Our task is to design a DroneGo disaster response system to support potential future disaster scenario similar as the Puerto Rico hurricane. Based on the 2017 situation in Puerto Rico, we will: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the packing configuration for each of no more than three ISO cargo containers to transport the system.
	\item Find the best locations on Puerto Rico to position these cargo containers to realize both medical supply delivery and video reconnaissance.
	\item Design the drone payload packing configurations, delivery routes and schedule to conduct medical supply delivery, and a drone flight plan to realize video reconnaissance of road networks.
\end{itemize}



\section{General Assumptions}
\textbf{Assumption I}: DroneGo disaster response system consists of up to three ISO cargo containers, a DroneGo fleet and some emergency medical packages. 

\noindent The three cargo containers are identical with standard size, designated as Container A, Container B and Container C respectively. The DroneGo fleet is a combination of drones selected from eight types of potential candidates, namely Drone A to Drone H. Only three types of emergency medical packages are available, referred to as MED 1, MED 2, and MED 3.

\noindent\textbf{Assumption II}: DroneGo disaster response system is designed for possible Puerto Rico hurricane disaster. 

\noindent When disasters occurs, a DroneGo fleet and some emergency medical packages will be packed in up to three cargo containers first of all. 

\noindent Next, each cargo container will be transported to one of the 32 populated places, which are represented by yellow square in Attachment 1, to ensure that DroneGo disaster response system can be timely discovered and well operated. 

\noindent Then both drones and medical packages will be taken out of the containers, and afterwards the latter will be packed into the drone cargo bay that is in fixed connection with the drone. 

\noindent Finally, all drones will depart from the up to three container locations and fly along the main roads on schedule. As is shown in Attachment 1, these main roads connect 32 populated places and make a road network. It is worth pointing out that there are two possible situations for these drones. If the drone carries a cargo bay with medical packages in it, the drone must fly via five locations in need of medical assistance, referred to as five destinations: Jajardo, San Pablo, San Juan, Bayamon and Arecibo, for the purpose of offloading its cargo. However, if the drone carries no cargo, any route without deviation of the road network is allowed.

\section{Integer programming model for single objective}

The DroneGo disaster response system is sent to Puerto Rico for two major missons: medical supply delivery and video reconnaissance of road networks, none of which is dispensable. Nevertheless, to start with, focusing on the former solely helps attain a clear insight into this sophisticated problem. That leads to our integer programming model.

\subsection{Analysis and assumptions}

\noindent Now assume that the response system are only for medical supply delivery and that the location of each container is so close to its destination that each drone can reach it before the power supply runs out. According to the requirement, the response system must meet the daily medical package demand of the five selected locations in Puerto Rico. Therefore, a natural objective is to maximize the so-called supporting days $d$. Suppose that the amount of the medical packages provided by the Drone fleet can serve location $j$ $(j=1,2,\cdots,5)$ for $d_j$ days. Then the supporting days is defined as
\begin{equation*}
	d=\min\{d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4,d_5\}.
\end{equation*}
For the sake of the optimization of $d$, a lot of independent variables need to be specified appropriately. Firstly, we need to specify the number of the containers transported to the disaster area. We introduce binary variables $X$, $Y$, $Z$ to indicate whether the corresponding cargo container is utilized respectively. Secondly, we have to decide the packing configuration for each container in use. Given the definition of $X_\alpha$ and $X_{\alpha ij}$ in section \ref{section:Sym}, the number of each item to be packed into container $X$ (8 types of drones: Drone A to Drone H; 3 types of medical packages: MED1, MED2, MED3) can be expressed as
 
\begin{equation*}
	X_A,\cdots,X_H,\sum_{\alpha=A}^H\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 1j},\sum_{\alpha=A}^H\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 2j},\sum_{\alpha=A}^H\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 3j}
\end{equation*} 
respectively. Likewise, we can choose values for $Y_\alpha,Y_{\alpha ij}$ and $Z_{\alpha},Z_{\alpha ij}$ to give the packing configuration for the container $Y$ and the container $Z$ respectively. Thirdly, we have to decide the drone payload packing configurations, or alternatively how the medical packages are packed into the drone cargo bay. The number of each type of medical package to be packed into the drone $\alpha$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 1j},\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 2j},\sum_{j=1}^{5}X_{\alpha 3j}
\end{equation*} Finally, the destination of each drone should be given. That is exactly what the variables $X_{\alpha ij},Y_{\alpha ij},Z_{\alpha ij}$ indicate. In a word, we need to adjust the 9 variables
\[
X,Y,Z,X_{\alpha},Y_{\alpha},Z_{\alpha},X_{\alpha ij},Y_{\alpha ij},Z_{\alpha ij}
\]
for the maximization of $d$.

\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{Interpretation}


\noindent Then we will explicitly explain the implications of all the constrains. Constrains (1)-(6) which characterize the volume inequalities are necessary but not sufficient conditions for medical packages to be totally packed into the drone cargo bays. We dispose of the bin packing problem for the time being, since the calculation can be considerably simplified in this way. Similarly, Constrains (7)-(9) are necessary but not sufficient conditions for drones and medical packages to be packed into the containers successfully. Since $M$ is a sufficiently large positive number, constrains (10)-(12) will be activated if only if $X_\alpha$, $Y_\alpha$ or $Z_\alpha$ equal 0. Hence it is impossible for unused drone cargo bays to be loaded any goods in. Likewise, Constrains (13)-(15) can avoid packing items in a unused container. Constrains (16)-(18) indicates that $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are binary variables. Constraints (19)-(21) exclude the case that the weight of medical packages exceeds the max payload capability of the drone. Constrains (22)-(31) assures that the medical package demand can be satisfied for the first $d$ days at least. Constrain (32) is just a standard condition in any integer programing problem. 

\subsection{Variation}

\noindent If we take the cost of containers, drones and medical packages into consideration and fix the value of $d$, minimizing the total cost also makes sense. To address the minimization problem, we only need to transform the objective function into the following form while all original constraints (1)-(32) still hold:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\min\quad\sum_{\alpha=A}^{H}\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j=1}^{5}c_{i}\left(X_{\alpha ij}+Y_{\alpha ij}+Z_{\alpha ij}\right)
+\sum_{\alpha=A}^{H}C_{{\alpha}}\left(X_{\alpha}+Y_{\alpha }+Z_{\alpha }\right)+W(X+Y+Z).
\end{aligned}
\]



\section{Integrated model for double objectives}
Now it is time to extend our analysis to the complete case that both medical supply delivery and video reconnaissance of road networks need to be carried out.

\subsection{Road Network Detection}
To decide the best locations of cargo containers and make a drone flight plan to realize video reconnaissance of road networks, we are supposed to add road network information to the model.     
\begin{figure}[h]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{1.jpg}
	\caption{Map of Puerto Rico} \label{fig:Map of Puerto Rico}
\end{figure}\\
Based on the following map (Figure 1) provided in Attachments, we use AutoCAD to extract the regional road network of Puerto Rico. The results of road network extraction are shown in Figure 2. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{8.png}
	\caption{Road Network} \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}\\
\subsubsection{Road Network Topology}
For simplification, we use matrix to represent the topological structure of road network. As shown in the figure below, the simple road network can be represented as a four-dimensional matrix. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{9.png}
	\caption{Simple Road Network} \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
{0} & {23.2 } & {43.04 }& {39.28 }  \\
{23.2 } & {0 } & {27.92 } & {-1 } \\
{43.04 } & {27.92  } & {0 } & {-1 } \\
{39.28 } & {-1  } & {-1 } & {0 } \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\]
Similarly, the actual road map shown below, can be expressed as a 32-dimensional matrix. Note that points 1 to 5 in the figure represent hospitals, and other points are mainly residential areas.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{6.png}
	\caption{Actual Road Network} \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Analysis and assumptions}
 Since the variable $d$ named supporting days has been shown to be a reasonable measure of the effect of medical supply delivery, developing some appropriate measures of the effect of video reconnaissance is our priority.

\noindent Assume that drones cannot be recharged, which implies each drone will fly along the road network until its batter is discharged. When the number of drones is rather large, it is totally reasonable to assume that under no circumstances will any two drones fly abreast along a same road. Thus the sum of flight distances of all the drones can well measure the effect of video reconnaissance. Note that Drone F is not capable of recording video. We can deduce the total flight distance
\[
L=\sum_{\substack{\alpha=A\\ \alpha\ne F}}^{G}l_\alpha (X_\alpha+Y_\alpha+Z_\alpha).
\]
There are several methods of multiobjective optimization. Here we choose a simple linear weighing method in order to obtain a integer programming model. Let $\lambda$ be the weight indicating the significance of the video reconnaissance of road networks compared to medical supply delivery. Then we need to manipulate variables to maximize the weighted measure
\[
d+\lambda L.
\] 
Besides the 9 variables
\[
X,Y,Z,X_{\alpha},Y_{\alpha},Z_{\alpha},X_{\alpha ij},Y_{\alpha ij},Z_{\alpha ij}
\]
considered in the integer programming model for single objective, We need additional variables to describe the location of the container $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, or more specifically, to describe which node  every container should be sent to given the network of roads. Therefore, we resort to binary variables $U_{Xm}$

\subsection{Formation}
The objective function of this model is shown as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\max\quad d+\lambda\sum_{\substack{\alpha=A\\ \alpha\ne F}}^{G}l_\alpha (X_\alpha+Y_\alpha+Z_\alpha)
\end{aligned}
\]
In additional to constraints (1)-(32) introduced in section 4, new constraints (33)-(39) must hold in the maximization problem. 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{s.t.}&
\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
\sum\limits_{m=1}^{T}U_{Xm}\le1&(33)\\
\sum\limits_{m=1}^{T}U_{Ym}\le1&(34)\\
\sum\limits_{m=1}^{T}U_{Zm}\le1&(35)\\
\sum\limits_{i=1}^3X_{\alpha ij}\le M(1-U_{Xm})\quad\text{ if }l_{\alpha}< f(m,j) ,\\\qquad\text{ for }\alpha=A,\cdots,G,m=1,\cdots,T,j=1,\cdots,5&(36)\\
\sum\limits_{i=1}^3Y_{\alpha ij}\le M(1-U_{Ym})\quad\text{ if }l_{\alpha}< f(m,j)  ,\\\qquad\text{ for }\alpha=A,\cdots,G,m=1,\cdots,T,j=1,\cdots,5&(37)\\
\sum\limits_{i=1}^3Z_{\alpha ij}\le M(1-U_{Zm})\quad\text{ if }l_{\alpha}< f(m,j)  ,\\\qquad\text{ for }\alpha=A,\cdots,G,m=1,\cdots,T,j=1,\cdots,5&(38)\\
U_{Xm},U_{Ym},U_{Zm} \in \{0,1\}&(39)
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{Variation}
Just by replacing the objective function yields the corresponding cost minimization problem
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min\quad&\sum_{\alpha=A}^{H}\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j=1}^{5}c_{i}\left(X_{\alpha ij}+Y_{\alpha ij}+Z_{\alpha ij}\right)
+\sum_{\alpha=A}^{H}C_{{\alpha}}\left(X_{\alpha}+Y_{\alpha }+Z_{\alpha }\right)+W(X+Y+Z)\\
&-\lambda\sum_{\substack{\alpha=A\\ \alpha\ne F}}^{G}l_\alpha (X_\alpha+Y_\alpha+Z_\alpha),
\end{aligned}
\]
while all constraints (1)-(39) must hold.

\section{Modified model based on bin-packing algorithm}

In this section we are to resolve a major defect in our previous models. We have been supposing that various items can be packed into a bin if the total volume of all items is not greater than the interior volume of the bin. However, simulation software  

\subsection{Simulated Annealing Algorithm}
\subsubsection{Background}
Simulated annealing arithmetic was formed in the early 1980s. Its idea originated from the annealing process of solids, heating solids to a sufficiently high temperature and then cooling them slowly. When the temperature was raised, the internal energy of particles in solids became disordered and increased, while when the temperature was slowly cooled, the particles gradually became orderly. In theory, if the cooling process was slow enough, then either of them would be cooled. Solids can achieve thermal equilibrium at temperature, and when cooled to low temperature, they will reach the minimum state of internal energy at this low temperature. \\     

In this process, it is an important step to achieve thermal equilibrium at any constant temperature. When applying simulated annealing to optimization problems, temperature T can generally be regarded as control parameter, objective function value f as internal energy E, and a state of solid at a certain temperature T corresponds to a solution x. Then the algorithm tries to reduce the objective function value f (internal energy E) gradually with the decrease of the control parameter T until it reaches the global minimum (the lowest energy state in low temperature annealing), just like the solid annealing process.\\
\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set the initial annealing temperature $T_0$, and generate an initial solution $x_0$ at random and calculate the corresponding objective function $E(X_0)$.
	\item Make $T$ equal to the next value in the cooling schedule $T_i$.
	\item Pick a random neighbour of the current solution $x_i$, generate a new solution $x_j$, calculate the corresponding objective function value $E(x_j)$, and get $\Delta E=E(x_j)-E(x_i)$.
	\item If  $\Delta E > 0$, the new solution $x_j$ is accepted as the new current solution; otherwise, $x_j$ is accepted with a probability of $exp(-\Delta E/T_i)$. 
	\item Repeat steps 3 and 4 $L_k$ times at temperature $T_i$.
	\item Transfer the algorithm  to step 2 till $T=T_f$.
\end{itemize}
The algorithm is essentially divided into two layers of cycles, generating new solutions at any temperature random disturbance, and calculating the change of the objective function value to determine whether it is accepted or not. Because the initial temperature of the algorithm is relatively high, the new solution of increasing E may also be accepted at the beginning, so it can jump out of the local minimum, and then by slowly lowering the temperature, the algorithm may eventually converge to the global optimal solution. It is also pointed out that although the acceptance function is very small at low temperature, the possibility of accepting worse solutions is still not excluded. Therefore, the best feasible solution (historical optimal solution) encountered in annealing process is generally recorded and output together with the last accepted solution before terminating the algorithm.
